# Axe Mining

Axe mining is a dynamic turn-based game made for an academic gamejam where our condition was to use a custom grid (No tilemap were used in this project). You are a dwarf mining ore in a cave. The pickaxe was too expensive (There was a character asset dwarf with a pickaxe but it required money, this is a gamejam, we can only use free assets therefore it was too expensive ;p) so you are using an axe instead. Avoid the bombos and dive into this short (but great) adventure!

# Controls

- Moving : Arrow keys and/or WASD keys
- Mine: Just move towards the wall containing the ore

# This game uses the following pre-made assets:

- Sounds effects and music were taken from [opengameart](opengameart.org) like the main title music composed by [Fabian](https://opengameart.org/users/of-far-different-nature).
- The sprite of the dwarf was made by the amazing [Elthen](https://elthen.itch.io/).
- The other sprites were all made either by OrniFrost or Dbien on Aseprite.

## And the team was:

- [Gabin Blondieau](https://github.com/OrniFrost)
- [Thomas Chu](https://github.com/GitGudShu)
- [Florent Desbiens](https://github.com/FlorentDesbiens)
